        <h2>
          About me
        </h2>
        <p>My name is Bryan Montero, and I am an enthusiastic and motivated undergraduate Computer Science student, ready to learn and collaborate to obtain new skills and gain experience to become an excellent software developer. Born in Cuba where I used to play soccer a lot as a kid and became part of a circus once for around 8 months (never got to perform in front of an audience). Currently reside in Hialeah Gardens, I live with my girlfriend and mother-in-law; we have a dog Named Milo and a cat named Sisyphus. My catâ€™s name came from the Greek mythological character and I named him that way because of the book written by Albert Camus The Myth of Sisyphus. Camus is special to me since he introduced me to the field of philosophy which I enjoy a lot as a hobby. I also enjoy doing some boxing every day with a punching bag that I have, it keeps my body and mind active and helps me study better. I am majoring in Computer Science, and I want to become a software developer. I have taken classes or learned about the languages: Java, C++, and Python as well as some Html and CSS. I want to impact the lives of the people around me in a good way and I think that this path can help me achieve that. I am interested in projects that challenge me and make me be creative and projects that are going to help people. </p>
